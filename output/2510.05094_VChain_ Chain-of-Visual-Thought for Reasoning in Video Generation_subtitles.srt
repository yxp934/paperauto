当前AI视频只会“画”不会“想”，导致逻辑混乱、前后矛盾。VChain提出一个颠覆性思路：先用GPT-4o这类大模型构思出几个关键“快照”，再指导视频生成。这种“视觉思维链”让AI首次拥有了真正的因果推理能力。

Today's AI video generation models can create stunning visual spectacles. But

4
00:00:34,157 --> 00:00:48,384
have you noticed that beneath their polished surface, these videos often hide

5
00:00:47,884 --> 00:01:02,112
logical flaws? For example, a glass might shatter before a ball even touches it.

6
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:15,340
This reveals a core challenge: AI lacks an understanding of causality. Today,

7
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:41,302
In recent years, video generation technology has made incredible strides. We've

8
00:01:40,802 --> 00:02:06,765
gone from generating a few seconds of blurry footage to creating minute-long,

9
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:32,227
high-definition, and smooth videos. AI's ability to 'paint' has become

10
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:57,189
increasingly sophisticated. However, a significant bottleneck emerges when we

11
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:30,772
So, how does VChain actually perform? Experimental results show a significant

12
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:53,394
improvement in video quality and logical coherence, especially for scenes with

13
00:06:52,894 --> 00:07:16,017
complex dynamics and multi-step causal relationships. Unlike traditional

14
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:38,139
end-to-end methods, VChain effectively avoids logical fallacies, producing

15
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:53,680
The introduction of VChain holds significant meaning for both academic research

16
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:08,720
and industrial applications. Academically, its main contribution is the concept

17
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:23,759
of a 'Visual Chain of Thought.' We've designed a reasoning-time framework that

18
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:38,299
injects external reasoning into pre-trained models without altering their core
