    "text": "Hello everyone, today we'll deeply analyze the important survey paper 'Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models,' which systematically organizes optimization methods for video foundation models after pre-training for the first time, filling a research gap in this field. We'll focus on three key post-training pillars: supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling, exploring how they address core challenges in video understanding like spatiotemporal localization and long-sequence processing. Through this presentation, you'll master the key technical pathways for video foundation models to accomplish complex reasoning tasks.",

    "title": "【背景介绍】",
    "text": "Current video understanding technology faces three core challenges: the spatiotemporal localization problem, where models must comprehend both spatial layouts and temporal evolution in videos; the efficiency issue with long video processing, as traditional methods struggle to capture key information in long sequences; and the complexity of multimodal evidence fusion, requiring coordination of visual, audio, text, and other multi-source information. While foundational video models have basic perceptual capabilities, they still perform poorly on complex reasoning tasks. This capability gap makes post-training optimization a key breakthrough for enhancing model performance. It is within this context that our paper provides the first systematic review of post-training methods for large video models, offering a theoretical framework and methodological guidance for building more powerful video reasoning engines.",

    "title": "【技术原理详解】",
    "text": "The paper categorizes video large model post-training methods into three technical pillars. The first pillar is supervised fine-tuning, which employs chain-of-thought training strategies to guide the model in establishing mapping relationships from visual perception to logical reasoning. For example, when analyzing a basketball player's shooting motion, the model must first recognize the action sequence before deducing technical points - this step-by-step reasoning capability is achieved through carefully designed supervised fine-tuning. The second pillar is reinforcement learning, whose core lies in designing verifiable reward functions to optimize model behavior. The paper emphasizes that video tasks require reward mechanisms across spatial and temporal dimensions, such as providing higher rewards for accurate localization of key events in long videos, which differs significantly from traditional text task reward designs. The third pillar, test-time scaling, enhances performance by increasing computational resources during inference, with typical methods including multi-frame sampling strategies and temporal attention enhancement. This approach doesn't require model retraining but optimizes the inference process to unlock model potential. The proposed structured taxonomy clearly demonstrates how these three methods work synergistically: supervised fine-tuning establishes foundational capabilities, reinforcement learning optimizes decision processes, and test-time scaling further enhances performance during deployment. Notably, all these methods are specifically adapted for video data characteristics, such as incorporating hierarchical attention mechanisms for temporal modeling and employing memory compression techniques for long video processing.",

    "title": "【性能表现与应用】",
    "text": "In performance evaluation, the paper systematically examines core metrics for video understanding, including spatiotemporal localization accuracy, multimodal fusion consistency, and long-video F1 scores. While the survey doesn't provide specific experimental data, analysis of representative methods shows that systematically post-trained models significantly outperform base models on complex reasoning tasks. In practical applications, these technologies demonstrate substantial potential: in intelligent surveillance, they enable anomaly detection and causal reasoning of events; in human-computer interaction, they can understand sequential action commands and provide appropriate responses; in long-video analysis, they automatically generate content summaries and extract key frames. Particularly noteworthy is that in specialized domains like medical diagnosis and industrial quality inspection, post-training helps models develop domain-specific reasoning logic, substantially enhancing practical value. Compared to mainstream base perception systems, post-training methods elevate Video-LMMs from simple pattern recognition to complex reasoning, enabling models not just to 'see' video content but to 'understand' logical relationships and spatiotemporal evolution.",

    "title": "【意义影响与展望】",
    "text": "This work establishes the first theoretical framework for video foundation model post-training, providing a clear technical roadmap for future research. At the industrial level, our systematic post-training approach significantly lowers the barrier for video AI applications, enabling developers to rapidly build domain-specific video understanding systems based on general models. Future development focuses on three key dimensions: optimizing reward mechanisms by designing functions that better capture video temporal characteristics, improving computational efficiency particularly for scalable long-video processing, and refining multimodal alignment to enable more precise fusion of visual, audio, and other semantic information. Current challenges include the high dependency in reward design that may cause overfitting, computational resource constraints limiting edge device deployment, and the need for stronger cross-domain generalization. These open problems point to breakthrough directions including developing more efficient parameter fine-tuning methods, designing unbiased reward mechanisms, and establishing more comprehensive evaluation systems.",

    "text": "Today we systematically interpreted the technical framework for video large model post-training, with a focused analysis of the three pillar methods: supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling. The paper's core contribution lies in constructing the first comprehensive post-training classification system and proposing systematic solutions to address the unique spatiotemporal reasoning challenges in video. These methods elevate video understanding from basic perception to new heights of complex reasoning. For audiences interested in further research, we recommend focusing on the implementation details of representative methods and evaluation protocols mentioned in the paper, while considering optimization directions for post-training strategies in practical application scenarios. This field remains in a rapid development phase, and we look forward to more researchers advancing the boundaries of video reasoning technology together.",
